# GBIF Taxonomy to OWL Converter

## Overview

This Python program fetches taxonomic classification information for a list of species from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API and generates an Ontology Web Language (OWL) representation of the taxonomy. It is designed to handle multiple species, ensuring that higher taxonomic levels are represented only once, even if they are shared across species.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

To install the required requests library, run:

`pip install requests`

## Usage

Start by defining a list of scientific names for the species you're interested in. For example:

```python
species_names = [
    "Apis mellifera",
    "Bos taurus",
    "Panthera leo"
]
```

Execute the program. It will iterate over each species name, fetch its taxonomic data from the GBIF API, and accumulate the unique taxonomic levels.

The program generates an OWL representation of the accumulated taxonomy, ensuring that each taxonomic level is included only once, and prints it to the console.

## Functions

### `fetch_gbif_data(scientific_name)`

Fetches taxonomic classification from the GBIF API for a given scientific name.

- Parameters: `scientific_name` (str) - The scientific name of the species.
- Returns: JSON object containing the taxonomic classification from GBIF.

### `accumulate_taxa(data, taxa)`

Accumulates unique taxa and their relationships from the GBIF data.

Parameters:
- `data` (dict) - The taxonomic data for a species.
- `taxa` (dict) - A dictionary to accumulate unique taxonomic information.
  
### `generate_owl(taxa)`
Generates an OWL representation from the accumulated taxa.

Parameters: taxa (dict) - A dictionary containing unique taxonomic information.
Returns: A string containing the OWL representation of the taxonomy.

### Example

```python
species_names = ["Apis mellifera", "Bos taurus", "Panthera leo"]
taxa = {}
for name in species_names:
    data = fetch_gbif_data(name)
    accumulate_taxa(data, taxa)

owl_data = generate_owl(taxa)
print(owl_data)
]
```
## Notes

This program is designed for educational and research purposes. It demonstrates how to interact with the GBIF API and process taxonomic data.
The OWL representation generated by this program is simplified and intended as a starting point for more complex ontology projects.
